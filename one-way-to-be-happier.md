# One Way To Be Happier

What is one way to be happier. Do more of what you want to do?
OK... that's obvious! It's literally a circular definition. 
By virtue of wanting something, getting it would make you happier
because it satisfies your desire. So what do you want? If you are currently
breathing, you probably want a LOT of things. Learn a new language, work out
more, spend more time with your friend and family, learn more, advance your career, make
more money, travel, be more organized, blah blah blah. So by virtue of living,
there are a lot of things we want to make our lives easier. 

We may define a problem as something that makes our life harder and a desire as
a solution to that problem ultimately making our lives easier or more
enjoyable. So have you accomplished all of those things? Of course NOT! Our
minds are powerful enough to imagine solutions to problems that we nevertheless
do not have the time to solve. Knowing that a solution to some problem exists
(I'll be more fit and have more energy if I exercise more and eat healthier),
yet not acting on it or solving it leads us to a discrepancy. Imagine the
narrative I'm sure you've had 

> I know how to get what I want. I know that if I just get myself in the gym a
> couple of times a week then I'll be healthier and look better. I'll be more
> slim and I could fit in that thing I wanted to wear or look the way I want
> to.

Now we've reached a dilemma. We know the solution to a problem that ales us,
but we're not willing to enact the solution. Somehow the cost of getting what
we want is so great that we cannot motivate ourselves to solve it. How can we
be content with this? The discrepancy between what we're willing to do in the
moment and what we truly want in the long term creates a conflict. We have
conflicting ideas of ourself. No one has imposed this issue but us. There are
two things we want and they are competing. What we want now and what we want in
the future. So how do we choose. How should we even begin to choose. What if we
look at frequency? For instance, which one do you think about more often.

Every desire we have is bound by some time scale. I want to relax when I get
home from work because I've had a long day. The alternative. I want to exercise
more. One immediate, one long term. 

Chances are, the long term goal continually crosses your mind whereas the
immediate desire is context specific and only exists because of what you're
doing right now. For example, someone made you angry today so you don't feel
like going to the gym.

So in the moment, which one do you choose and why? The hardest thing about this
problem is that you have to choose between two things that YOU want to do. No
one told you to do these things. In fact these are the very things that make
you happier when you do them. So... you should probably do them. 

What will make you happy right now (maybe a cupcake?) will make you unhappy in
the future (gain weight). However, when you do the things that make you happy
right now, you are happy right now. When you do the things that will make you
happy in the future, you will be unhappy for an indefinite amount of time. You
don't know for sure if your happiness will come. A bird in hand is worth two in
the bush.

But you know for sure that should you accomplish that long term goal (getting a
degree perhaps) that you will be substantially happier than if you compromise the
long term goal for something that will make you happy now (maybe going out with
your friends). Key point being "you'll be substantially happier." In a sense,
you're denying yourself happiness. You're literally choosing to be LESS happy.
But you're still happy RIGHT? just less happy. 

Herein lies the conflict. You have knowingly chosen an option that leads to you
being less happy. Not only that, you have chosen to do something that depends
on your current situation and not on your long term desires. You have chosen to
be something that you don't want to be.

If we want long term happiness, we must choose long term desires.
