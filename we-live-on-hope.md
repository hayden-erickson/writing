# We Live On Hope

[Home](./README.html)


### What I think: 
	
As humans, we are the only species that is able to fabricate a fictional 
situation, follow its actions, and then determine the most efficient and 
effective solution. If we are to survive, we must use this ability to keep 
ourselves out of harm's way and ultimately live happier lives. 

Another trait we have as humans is sympathy. When we imagine a situation 
with a negative outcome, we feel bad because we see ourselves feeling bad or 
suffering. When we imagine a situation with a positive outcome, we feel good.
Therefore, to make ourselve feel good, we can imagine a positive situation 
happening. Hope  then is what allows us to survive as humans. We figure out
what it is that would make us the happiest and then we Hope for it to happen.
The good feelings that Hope produces create our motivation and drive action.

Our empathy is the foundation of society and is what allows us to live in peace
with each other. Through language (*our uniquely human ability*), our empathy towards others increased
because we could all share how we felt. Knowing that others feel the same way we do is reassuring.
When a feeling is especially frequent among us we typically agree that it is true. These 
things we call facts give us guidence when we are afraid. Without them we are not able 
to ignore our imagined negative consequences and can't focus on the possibilities we 
actually have control over. 

Another benefit language brought us was culture. It may seem irrelevant, but without it 
no scientific advances could have happened, no civil rights movements our human progress.
These events stand a testament to our ability to collectively agree on something and then 
execute it. Given enough of these experiences we as humans determine the things that do 
work and quickly abandoned the things that don't. Just as parents pass down mantras and 
catchphrases that will only every become evident for some reason after we have made the 
very mistake that motivated our parents to pass it to us. We always think of them as 
knowing the future. They know what is going to happen before it does because of the collective
culture and knowledge. 


As a society we use this knowledge to predict our future outcomes that we most desire
and plan for them, hope  for them. When we expose enough truths about a given situation,
its outcome becomes apparent. However, before its discovery, knowing the outcome of that 
event would have been to predict the future. If we progress enough as humans, we may learn
one day to accurately predict the outcome of our universe and many of its truths. Given 
what we already know, we can accurately and testably predict and determine universal 
properties that ever more so are blurring the lines between time and space. At the rate 
we're going, our posterity may find subtle methods of reaching out to us to communicate
what they have determined to be an absolute truth enabling us to live longer and happier
lives. But, that is just my hope.
